Two!Ears binaural simulator
===========================

The Two!Ears binaural simulator enables the creation of binaural audio signals
for different situations. This is done via the usage of head-related transfer
functions (HRTFs) or binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs), which are provided
in the [Two!Ears data] repository.

## Installation

TODO

## Usage

Add descriptions for the following applications of the model and add a general
description at this position.

See the [API documentation] for further details.

Explain the usage of the xml-configuration file and the possibility to set the
values without configuration file.

### Simulate direct sound

Explain how to use HRTFs


### Dynamic scenes

Explain how to rotate the head and how to create moving sources.


### Simulate rooms

Explain how to incorporate rooms from BRIRs, image source model, and plane waves
for diffuse sound.


### Incorporate binaural room scanning files

Explain how to use BRS files used with the SoundScape Renderer.
