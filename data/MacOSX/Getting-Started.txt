GETTING (THE SSR) STARTED

You should have a proper version of Jack installed by now (32 or 64 bit - matching the architecture of the SSR build you are using). If not, get it from http://www.jackosx.com/

Run JackPilot from the Jack folder located inside your Applications folder. In JackPilot press START. This will start the Jack server process in background, which is needed by the SSR.

You can now quit JackPilot if you want - the Jack server will continue to run in background.

Run the SSR itself. It consists of a GUI and a terminal window giving you information about interesting things (e.g. if you forgot to start Jack). If something is not working, have a look there.
